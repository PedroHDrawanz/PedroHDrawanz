Hi, i'm Pedro Henrique Drawanz, i'm a 16 years old developer, i've been developing simple things focused in games since i was 11.
I started in the roblox community, as a kid, i wondered how was like to make a game, and so i did, spent some 6 months learning lua script, and released it on roblox,
nothing to much of complex, but i was able to reach some hundreds of people, sadly i don't have the projects anymore, as it years ago. 
Currently i study C#, to continue with my love for games, i started learning how to use unity game engine, i had to choose between unity or unreal engine, i think both are exeptional,
but i choose unity beacuse of it's speed and programming language, as my favorite is C#, but it's not like i don't like c++, it's just a preference.
I'm corrently studying for some future project, for me programming is something that has been in my life since times ago, and i love it.
